    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy and quick recipe! Great for breakfast or dessert!</p>
    <p>Tip: This keeps well in the freezer!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp cold butter*</li>
        <li>1/2 cup blueberries, frozen or fresh</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Zest and juice the lemon. You'll need about 1 tsp lemon zest for the dough and 2 Tbsp lemon juice for the glaze.
        </li>
        <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and lemon zest in a large bowl. Stir until they are very well combined.
        </li>
        <li>Grate the butter into the flour mixture and stir until the butter is well incorporated and no large lumps remain.*
        </li>
        <li>Add the blueberries to the flour mixture and stir to combine (no need to thaw first, if frozen).
        </li>
        <li>Whisk together the milk and eggs, then pour it into the bowl with the flour and bluberries. Stir everything together until it forms a cohesive ball of dough, with no dry flour remaining on the bottom of the bowl.<br>If the dough is too dry to come together into a single ball of dough, add a splash more milk (1 Tbsp or so) until it comes together.
        </li>
        <li>Press the dough out into a flat 8-inch diameter circle. Cut the circle into eight wedges. Place the cut scones on a parchment lined baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the scones in the preheated 425ºF oven for 15-17 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Transfer the baked scones to a wire rack to cool.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the scones to cool completely, then combine 1 cup powdered sugar with 2 Tbsp lemon juice until it forms a thick glaze. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled scones, then enjoy!
